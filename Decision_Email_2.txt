Subject: NOT APPROVED â€“ AI/Data Project Governance Decision

To: Dr. Ravi Patel, Radiology Department
CC: Dr. John Doe, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Patel,

Following review of your project "Tumor Classifier for Public Presentation", it is NOT APPROVED due to the following policy violations:

- Use of PHI without IRB approval
- No Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place
- Public sharing planned without dissemination review
- No SNOMED CT or ICD-10-CM/PCS coding standards applied
- Project not logged in the Data Use Registry

Next Steps:

- Please work with Dr. John Doe to initiate IRB protocol review
- Submit a DUA through the governance committee
- Apply de-identification standards before resubmission
- Apply SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM/PCS coding standards to your dataset
- Log the project in the Data Use Registry
- Submit a Public Dissemination Request Form

We look forward to supporting your project once these compliance gaps are addressed.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
Chief Data Officer
