Subject: NOT APPROVED â€“ AI/Data Project Governance Decision

To: Dr. Ravi Patel, Radiology Department
CC: Dr. Olarinre Salako, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Patel,

Following review of your project "Tumor Classifier for Public Presentation", it is NOT APPROVED due to the following policy violations:

- Use of PHI without IRB approval
- No Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place
- Public sharing planned without dissemination review
- No SNOMED or ICD coding standards applied
- No project log in the Data Use Registry
- No Public Dissemination Request Form submitted

Next Steps:

- Please work with Dr. Olarinre Salako to initiate IRB protocol review
- Submit a DUA through the governance committee
- Apply SNOMED and ICD coding standards to your data
- Log the project in the Data Use Registry
- Submit a Public Dissemination Request Form
- Apply de-identification standards before resubmission

We look forward to supporting your project once these compliance gaps are addressed.

Sincerely,
Dr. Bill Gates
Chief Data Officer
