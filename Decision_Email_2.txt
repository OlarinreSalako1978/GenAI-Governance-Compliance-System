To: Dr. Ravi Patel, Radiology Department, UTSW Medical Center  
CC: Dr. Olarinre Salako, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence, UTSW Medical Center

Dear Dr. Patel,

Upon review of your project request titled "Tumor Classifier for Public Presentation," it has been determined that the proposal does not comply with the UT Southwestern AI-Data Governance Policy. Below are the identified violations and recommended actions to address these issues:

**Violations:**
- **IRB Approval:** The project involves the use of PHI but lacks IRB approval, which is mandatory for Tier 1 projects.
- **Data Use Agreement (DUA):** No DUA is attached despite the use of PHI.
- **SNOMED/ICD Coding:** The project does not apply SNOMED CT or ICD coding standards to the histopathological images.
- **Registry and Dissemination Compliance:** The project is not logged in the registry, and no dissemination form has been completed for the planned public presentation.

**Recommended Corrections:**
- **Obtain IRB Approval:** Submit the necessary documents for IRB review to ensure compliance with HIPAA and PHI standards.
- **Attach a DUA:** Complete and attach a DUA to ensure proper handling and use of PHI.
- **Apply Coding Standards:** Ensure that SNOMED CT and ICD coding standards are applied to the dataset.
- **Complete Registry and Dissemination Forms:** Log the project in the Data Use Registry and complete a dissemination form to align with public sharing policies.

**Next Steps:**
1. Coordinate with Dr. Olarinre Salako to address the above compliance issues.
2. Resubmit the project proposal with the necessary modifications and documentation.
3. Schedule a meeting with the AI Center of Excellence to review the revised proposal and ensure all governance standards are met before proceeding.

We appreciate your commitment to advancing medical research and innovation at UTSW. Please address these compliance issues promptly to move forward with your project.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
