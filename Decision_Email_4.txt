Subject: NOT APPROVED â€“ AI/Data Project Governance Decision

To: Dr. Thomas Rivera, Biomedical Informatics, UTSW Medical Center  
CC: Dr. Olarinre Salako, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence, UTSW Medical Center

Dear Dr. Rivera,

After careful review of your project request "LLM Fine-Tuning for Public Release," it has been determined that the project does not comply with the UT Southwestern AI-Data Governance Policy. Below are the identified violations and recommended actions to align the project with our governance standards:

**Violations:**
- **IRB Approval:** The project involves the use of PHI and intends for public dissemination, yet no IRB approval has been secured.
- **Data Use Agreement (DUA):** No DUA is attached despite the use of real patient data.
- **PHI Handling:** The project uses regex-masked PHI, which may not sufficiently mitigate the risk of re-identification.
- **SNOMED/ICD Mapping:** The absence of SNOMED or ICD coding standards compromises data integrity and interoperability.
- **Registry and Dissemination Compliance:** The project is not logged in the registry, and no dissemination form has been completed.

**Recommended Corrections:**
1. **Secure IRB Approval:** Initiate an IRB review process to ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards concerning PHI.
2. **Execute a DUA:** Formalize a DUA to clarify the terms of data use and responsibilities.
3. **Enhance PHI Masking:** Review and possibly enhance de-identification protocols to ensure they meet the stringent requirements necessary for public data release.
4. **Apply SNOMED/ICD Mapping:** Integrate appropriate coding standards to maintain data integrity and facilitate interoperability.
5. **Complete Registry and Dissemination Forms:** Log the project in the institutional registry and complete the necessary forms for public dissemination.

**Next Steps:**
- Collaborate with Dr. Olarinre Salako to address the compliance issues outlined.
- Resubmit the project proposal with the necessary modifications and documentation.
- Schedule a meeting with the AI Center of Excellence to discuss the revised project plan and ensure alignment with institutional goals and compliance standards.

We appreciate your commitment to advancing medical research and innovation at UT Southwestern. Please address these issues promptly so we can move forward with the approval process.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
