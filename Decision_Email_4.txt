Subject: NOT APPROVED â€“ AI/Data Project Governance Decision

To: Dr. Thomas Rivera, Biomedical Informatics Department
CC: Dr. Olarinre Salako, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Rivera,

Following review of your project "LLM Fine-Tuning for Public Release", it is NOT APPROVED due to the following policy violations:

- Use of PHI without IRB approval
- No Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place
- Public sharing planned without dissemination review
- No SNOMED or ICD coding standards applied
- No logging in the Data Use Registry
- No submission of Public Dissemination Request Form

Next Steps:

- Please work with Dr. Olarinre Salako to initiate IRB protocol review
- Submit a DUA through the governance committee
- Apply de-identification standards before resubmission
- Apply SNOMED or ICD coding standards to your data
- Log the project in the Data Use Registry
- Submit a Public Dissemination Request Form

We look forward to supporting your project once these compliance gaps are addressed.

Sincerely,
Dr. Bill Gates
Chief Data Officer
