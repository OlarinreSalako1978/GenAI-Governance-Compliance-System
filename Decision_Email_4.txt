Subject: NOT APPROVED â€“ AI/Data Project Governance Decision

To: Dr. Thomas Rivera, Biomedical Informatics
CC: Dr. John Doe, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Rivera,

Following review of your project "LLM Fine-Tuning for Public Release", it is NOT APPROVED due to the following policy violations:

- Use of PHI without IRB approval
- No Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place
- Public sharing planned without dissemination review
- SNOMED CT and ICD coding standards have not been applied
- The project has not been logged in the Data Use Registry

Next Steps:

- Please work with Dr. John Doe to initiate IRB protocol review
- Submit a DUA through the governance committee
- Apply de-identification standards before resubmission
- Ensure SNOMED CT and ICD coding standards are applied to your dataset
- Log the project in the Data Use Registry
- Submit a Public Dissemination Request Form

We look forward to supporting your project once these compliance gaps are addressed.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
Chief Data Officer
