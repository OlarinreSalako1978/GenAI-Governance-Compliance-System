To: Dr. Amina Yusuf, Medical Education
CC: Dr. John Doe, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Yusuf,

Your AI/Data project request titled "GenAI-Based Educational Module Builder" has been reviewed and is APPROVED. The proposal complies with UTSW's governance policy in the following ways:

- The project aligns with institutional and ethical goals, as it uses AI to generate educational content.
- The data required for the project is de-identified and has received IRB approval, ensuring compliance with HIPAA and PHI standards.
- The project has a Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place.
- The project uses SNOMED CT and ICD codes, ensuring correct mapping and data harmonization.
- The project is logged in the Data Use Registry, ensuring documentation and auditability.
- The project does not intend to publicly disseminate the data, thus a Public Dissemination Request Form is not required.

Next Steps:
- Continue collaboration with Dr. John Doe to ensure the AI model is developed and implemented in accordance with UTSW's AI governance policy.
- Ensure ongoing compliance with the DUA and IRB protocols.
- Maintain the project log in the Data Use Registry.

Thank you for your attention to compliance.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
