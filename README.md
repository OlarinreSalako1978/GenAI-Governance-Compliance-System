# GenAI-Powered AI/Data Governance Policy Enforcement

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) project demonstrating how Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to evaluate AI/data project requests against UT Southwestern Medical Centerâ€™s AI-Data Governance Policy.

---

## System Purpose

To automate early-stage compliance review for:
- Data request/sharing/publication
- AI model development
- Internal and external use of patient-related or synthetic datasets

## How It Works

1. Policy is chunked and indexed into FAISS.
2. Each project request is embedded and top-5 most relevant policy sections are retrieved.
3. GenAI (OpenAI GPT-4) evaluates compliance using the policy context.
4. A final decision email is generated and saved per request.

---

## Example Outputs

- Each reviewed request produces a `Decision_Email_X.txt`
- Emails include subject line, compliance decision, next steps, and are professionally formatted

---

## Policy Enforced

- HIPAA, PHI, IRB requirements
- Risk-tier controls (clinical vs. non-clinical)
- SNOMED/ICD alignment
- DUA and public dissemination policies

---

## Roles Simulated

- Chief Data Officer (CDO): Dr. Tammye Garrett
- Director of AI: Dr. John Doe
- Project Owners: Vary by request

---

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- `openai`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `matplotlib`, `PyPDF2`, `python-dotenv`
