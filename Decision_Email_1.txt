To: Dr. Emily Zhang, Health Information Management

Dear Dr. Zhang,

Your AI/Data project request titled "Internal NLP Summarization Model" has been reviewed and is fully APPROVED. The proposal complies with UTSW's governance policy in the following ways:
- Risk Tier: Tier 3 – Low Risk (internal NLP tool)
- SNOMED and ICD-10 standards applied
- Data Type: Synthetic notes only, no PHI involved
- No public dissemination planned
- Project is logged in the Data Use Registry

Next Steps:
- Work with Dr. John Doe to provision the synthetic dataset.
- Maintain minimal monitoring as per low-risk classification.
- Ensure internal code review, logging, and limited access are in place.

Thank you for your attention to compliance.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
