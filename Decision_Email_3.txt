To: Dr. Monica Ellis, Health Operations Analytics
CC: Dr. John Doe, Director of AI, AI Center of Excellence

Dear Dr. Ellis,

Your AI/Data project request titled "UT System Scheduling Optimization" has been reviewed and is APPROVED. The proposal complies with UTSW's governance policy in the following ways:
- Risk Tier: Tier 2 – Moderate Risk
- SNOMED and ICD-10 standards applied
- Data Type: Synthetic only, no PHI involved
- DUA is attached and logged in the Data Use Registry
- No public dissemination planned, hence no need for a Public Dissemination Request Form

Next Steps:
- Continue with the project as planned.
- Ensure all data sharing activities are logged in the Data Use Registry.
- Maintain regular monitoring as per moderate-risk classification.

Thank you for your attention to compliance.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tammye Garrett
